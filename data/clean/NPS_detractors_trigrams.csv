I had a deadline to get some files to my coworkers and Joey was very patient and calmed me down . He explained all the options . I chose to get the specific files in 30 minutes and then have them get the rest of the files off which would take longer . I got the important files in 30 minutes and was able to get them to my However the 2nd half of the request was very unsatisfactory . We gave them an external drive to put the files on and they were unable to use it, seems they didn't push a button necessary to turn it on . They rushed to get me the files before closing because the next day was Easter . I really appreciated that and the sold me a thumb drive to put the files on since they couldn't figure out the external hard drive . So I get home, put the thumb drive into my other computer and there are none of my files . Only weird shortcuts and admin files . I had 4 folders on the desktop filled with files and none of that was on the drive . I paid $216 for only 1 sets of files for my coworkers and after 8 hours with my computer none of the rest of my files .... highly disappointed!!! I kept trying on Sunday and Monday to get the computer to turn on . Finally Monday afternoon it turned on . I quickly downloaded my files onto the thumb drive . They were there and easily accessible, why your ""technical experts"" couldn't download them for me is beyond my understanding . I have 2 other very old laptops that I was going to bring in but now I worry that I won't get any files off of them .

I purchased a new laptop and left it with the Geek Squad at 10:00 on a Friday morning along with an external hard drive for data transfer . I was told the data transfer would take 2 - 3 days . I got a call on Monday morning (Memorial Day) to set up an appointment for that afternoon . I had plans so the 1 hour appointment was set for Tuesday morning at 10:30 . When I got there, the technician sat with me for the 1 hour struggling to set up my Outlook from an external email account . When he told me my hour was up and I needed to schedule another appointment, I asked to see the data that was transferred . He told me that the only instructions he had were to set up Outlook . I pointed out that he had my external hard drive sitting right next to the laptop and the guy that took everything on Friday was standing right next to him . Throughout the whole process the technician kept going in to a back room . Either he had a bad bladder, was in the middle of a hot text exchange or had to consult with the Wizard before he did anything . Nevertheless, nothing was completed and an appointment was set for Wednesday night at 5:20 . I was pulling in to the store lot at 5:15 Wednesday evening when I got a call that they had not been able to find the data to transfer from my hard drive or set up the email . Rather than set up another appointment after an ""advanced technician"" had a chance to work on it, I requested a refund . I then purchased a laptop at Costco, set up the email by myself on Thursday night and I am now up and running . I will NEVER purchase a product from Best Buy and I would certainly NEVER recommend the Geek Squad . My only advice, it the desk technician can't get the work done in a day or two, proactively have an advanced technician work on the product . You had almost 6 full days to get the work done on a new laptop that you had just sold before you were proposing to get an advanced technician involved.",0.0825718923933209,0.4298314780457638,this is my second geek squad experience in the past year the first was with an iphone both experiences were horrible resolving nothing and eating huge chunk of my time will not have third geek squad experience,"This is my second Geek squad experience in the past year .
