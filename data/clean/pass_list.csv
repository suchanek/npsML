Geek Squad tech JEREMY was very patient in quickly checking and servicing (""removing extensions"") my laptop which he said allowed it to operate better, especially w/more speed . He had to provide this service quickly, or reschedule me, because the employee (in Arizona) who previously scheduled my appointment by phone, had an incorrect/later closing time for the St. Petersburg, FL Best Buy . However, since I had driven through pouring rain to reach the store, Jeremy and 2 other Gk Sq techs kindly stayed a few over to help me . Another tech, Corey, even voluntarily insisted on GIVING me his umbrella to reach my car in the downpour as the store was closing when I left . The only PROBLEM I was concerned about with the service was that I requested a WRITTEN report of the work done on my laptop to be provided on the spot, as I've gotten for years in the past with Geek Squad, (or at least emailed to me later since the store was closing). Unfortunately, I was told I could NOT get report confirming the work done since the procedures are now changed . Specifically, they stated I could return to Best Buy in a few days and pick up a ""printout"" confirming the service that was done . However, for now they stated that the current Total Tech procedure only permitted them to email me a ""survey"" shortly after my visit for me to complete to provide feedback on the work done . THIS is the survey that I am completing now .

The Best Buy tech that initially diagnosed the problem was named Brian (or Bryan). He was friendly and informative . He recommended I buy a new battery (on Amazon) and bring it to BB for installation . When I brought the battery to Best Buy, the tech at the counter was named Richard . When I recounted my conversation with Brian, he immediately said that the diagnosis did not seem incorrect--that even if the battery was dead, the AC power supply was directly connected to the motherboard and the laptop would stay on when connected to AC power . I lamented that this was my second trip to the store and that I'd needlessly bought a battery, which now had to be returned to Amazon--an all round inconvenience . Additionally, we'd be back at square one to find and fix the actual problem . I saw Brian a few feet away and told him that I'd returned with the battery he recommended, but that Richard disagreed with his diagnosis . Richard acquiesced and said they'd install the battery to see if that was the problem so I left the laptop and battery with Richard . The next day, I got an automated call instructing me to come pick up the computer--without actually telling me that the problem was fixed . Then, a female tech called me to come pick up my computer so, I asked her if it was actually fixed or not . She didn't know anything about the discrepancy between Brian and Richard's opinions--she just knew that I needed to pick up the computer . When I got there, a female tech brought me my computer . I explained the confusion with the diagnosis again so she booted the computer up and it worked . I saw Brian a few feet away and thanked him and told him that his original diagnosis had been correct after all . I mostly bring this to your attention because I seem to remember Richard from a previous visit for repair (maybe three years ago) and his demeanor was negative at that time, as well .

I was told they would message me when it was done . I have a basic flip phone and I don't have messaging . I was then told I would be called on my cell phone . After three days of not being notified I called the store . After going through the menu, I needed to talk to a Geek Squad person at the store to find out about the computer . I waited for over five minutes for someone to take the call . No one did so I hung up . I did this again on the same day two more times with the same result . I ended up driving to the store so I could talk to someone in person about the status of my computer . The person I spoke to checked to see if it was done and it was finished a few days ago . I told that person that I was supposed to get a call when it was ready and I didn't receive one . His comment ""sorry about that"" in a very dismissive way . I only have this one computer . When I got it home and hooked up it had an e-mail from Geek Squad that my computer was ready to pick up . That e-mail was dated two days before I actually went down to pick up my computer . I'm not sure if the Greek Squad knows that I must have my computer in order to read any e-mails on it . Needless to say, I was very disappointed with this whole experience . I have never had this problem with this store in the past and never called there without anyone answering the phone when I called in the past.",-0.0789246632996633,0.424074074074074

That being said, I would recommend Geek Squad with the caveat that the technical experience was great but the personal experience was less than satisfactory at the drop off (this experience did get better by the time I left) and at the pick up, this experience did not get better . Both techs made me feel like I was taking up their time . I dropped off the new computer, the computer from which data was being transferred and a laptop to see if the performance could be improved . And I did it at 6:30 realizing you close at 7:00, but if you're open you're open and I didn't know how long it would take . As I mentioned - the tech was more engaged in helping me by the time I left and it was after 7 when we finished but it was a rocky start . From start to finish the pick up was uncomfortable . My understanding was that I would spend some time with the tech finishing the Microsoft 365 set-up (because my password was needed which is why I made an appointment to pick it up). I had also asked if my Webroot (purchased from Best Buy a few years ago) would be transferred over and it wasn't so I asked if we could also do that while I was picking it up . What I have to own in this deal - I did not have my Webroot or Microsoft passwords with me so it involved recovering passwords, etc . Another Geek Squad member showed a different way to download the Webroot without my password, it was nice of him to help . So my appointment was probably longer than normal but honestly - I paid the money to have someone help me because tech is not my strong suit but the tech's demeanor was unpleasant . Everyone has a difficult day - I don't know what is going on in her life but that day she needed to be behind the scenes working on computers, not dealing with the public .

Since I wouldn't have my phone for Geek Squad to call or text me when the job was completed, I provided an alternative phone number to call me when the job was done . Alex confirmed someone would call me at that number and also said I could call the store to check on things later if I chose . I don't know whose job/responsibility it was to call me, but no one called me to tell me the work was completed . When I called the store phone number, I was endlessly blocked via the automated phone system and my call was rerouted to someone in India . I tried to reach the store again, and this time I was rerouted to somewhere else in the US but told I could not be put through to the store . So no one called me to tell me the job was finished, and I couldn't reach the store to find out the work was finished . Finally I drove to the store after 3-1/2 hours and Alex retrieved my phone & told me the battery had been replaced as requested & paid for . I shared my frustration re the lack of a phone call; he shrugged it off that the technician must have been busy . I explained the inability to phone the store so he would understand the importance of that service breakdown . Upon returning home and opening my phone, I saw that Best Buy's automated system had emailed & texted me status updates re the work on my phone . But since I didn't have my phone, all of that was pointless and useless . As I understand business, when employees open their mouths and make statements or declarations such as ""We will call you when your phone is ready"", the customer has a reasonable expectation that someone will actually fulfill that promise . Clearly Geek Squad has no assumption or expectation that they will fulfill on their verbal promises, and no process to ensure that will happen . So bottom line for me: you did a great job servicing my phone, but you did a lousy job of servicing me as your customer . Love the product but hate the company . Feel free to call me if you should want to discuss further.",0.1202380952380952,0.5563492063492064

Shortly after my warranty with BB expired, I started experiencing disk errors that Windows 10 would attempt to repair automatically . As time went on, the problem got worse and the troubleshooting would take longer and longer . Eventually, the laptop became nearly unusable . I had just enough capability to back up my data and attempt to reset back to the factory settings, but it never fully recovered so I requested the appointment with GS to inquire about a repair . When I spoke with the GS rep about the difficulties I was experiencing with my computer, he seemed very knowledgeable and understood my expectations regarding the repair . Based on what this GS rep told me, GS would attempt to complete the reset and, if that didn't work, replace the hard drive with a new solid state drive to avoid future mechanical issues associated with a traditional disk drive (similar to what was causing this issue). The GS rep sold me on the TotalTech membership and informed me that when they (the repair representatives) completed their analysis, I would be given a phone call to discuss the identified issue (s) and confirm next steps for repair . The text I received on Thursday, June 2nd confirmed my laptop was checked info service . The next day, I received a text message indicating, ""Your device is ready and your pickup appt is scheduled for 6/6 @ 12:40 p.m."" No phone call letting me know what was done, the laptop's current status or whether the disk drive had been replaced . I attempted to call the store to get those answers and was routed to a customer service rep that was difficult to understand, didn't seem knowledgeable about my reported problem, the solution or whether or not I could pick up my laptop earlier than my scheduled appointment time, so I didn't bother trying to pick it up early . The scheduled pick-up time was not convenient for me because I had a work commitment at 1 p.m., so I came to the store early with the hopes that I would be able to pick up my laptop . The GS rep that assisted me retrieved my laptop and proceeded to turn it on . The GS rep told me that my Temporary files were deleted and a couple of issues with the operating system were fixed so my laptop should be ready to go . Several minutes go by and my computer was still unable to make it to the desktop, so I again reiterated that the previous GS rep (and I) were convinced that the disk errors were going to required a hard drive replacement . This GS rep took my laptop back into the maintenance area and then came out and facilitated the purchase of the new solid-state hard drive and indicated I would be able to come back in to pick up the laptop by the end of the day . If someone had called me I could've scheduled the pick-up at a time that was considerate of my schedule . If someone had called me, they would've realized that deleting the Temporary files and fixing a couple of issues with the OS did not resolve the issue and could've had the hard drive replaced without me having to drive to the store twice . I realize that the TotalTech membership is only a couple hundred dollars and is barely a drop in the bucket for BB's bottom line, but my time away from work helping your team resolve glaring customer service gaps/issues is worth more than a couple of hundred dollars . I have spent thousands of dollars at BB over the last 15-20 years because I have always believed that, despite the fact that you're a big box retailer, the people in your stores seem to genuinely care about the customer and the service they are able to provide . Please don't make me take the money I spend on electronics and give it to Bezos . I hate that douchebag.",0.0149339136041263,0.3842359767891682
