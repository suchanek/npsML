I asked for a battery replacement for a phone that was simply to be used as a toy for my nine year old . I knew the phone was old and not in great shape, I just wanted to do something small to make the phone a bit better . Instead, the tech person was forced to go through an entire diagnostic thing (even though I told him I was not going to pay for any other services and so the diagnostic results were irrelevant). I was there for almost an hour, only to be told at the end that they would not replace my battery because Apple wouldn't allow that . I understand that is not the fault of Geek Squad, BUT it was a terrible waste of my time and I think the entire thing could have been much more efficient if he hadn't first had to do the entire diagnostic . Also, when I arrived and told him why I was there (not sure why he didn't already know that since I made an appointment and was asked what service I needed), the first thing he did was check to see if they had a battery in the back, which was shocking to me . I scheduled the appointment and said why I was coming, Geek Squad should check prior to appointments to make sure all parts are available for the service . Essentially, I wanted one very simple service, spent an entire hour at the store have tests run on my phone that I didn't want, and then was denied the service . It showed very little regard for my time or right to make my own decisions about my own device . The tech support guy was very nice, so I don't blame him .

I was told that's not what the appointment was set for and they did not have the time to install my equipment . Then, finally after I 'settled' for just having my radio installed (two hours), I would have to pay labor charges since I did not purchase my equipment from BB . When I purchased the Total Tech, LAST YEAR, I made sure, that two separate AND a manager, tell me that I could purchase car audio from another source and my installation labor would be covered . Evidently, that has changed without being notified . This will NOT happen again, I can promise you that . Now, I have to drive back to BB, another 45 miles, to have my speakers installed and it's going to take another 3-4 hours to get that done .

Then I got emails that said if I don't pick up my parts (that I paid for!), they would be sent back . So, I had to extend the hold on my parts . I got the radio and spoke to the intaller about the fact that I was getting Sirius XM and he said it was going to be easy for me to set it up . The instructions were on the receipt . But, after fiddling with my radio for an hour, then calling a help desk, I still couldn't get Sirius XM . I came to the store and a female there said she didn't know how to resolve this but that if I came back on Wednesday, she would be there to help me (she was going to ask the radio installer how to do it). Well, I came back on Wednesday and of course she WASN'T there . But, some nice fellow came out to my car with me & tried his hardest to get it to work . After about 50 minutes, he discovered that I never paid for the extra part needed and that is most likely why I couldn't get it to work . I never noticed that I didn't get that extra part . Didn't even think to look because 2 people rang me up the day I purchased everything & they both kept saying .."" she needs this, and this, etc ."" They assured me that I had everything I would need . So finally, I went to Best Buy on Saturday and spoke with the installer guy . He said, yes, I would need that part to get Sirius XM . After 3 hours of trying, I decided to skip having Sirius XM and just use Pandora! Again, everyone was very nice but the process for this was awful and I ended up not getting what I wanted .

Due to the weight and size of the computer, I got a cart to assist me to bring the computer to the Geek Squad desk . To my dismay, as I pushed the cart through the tracks of the sliding door entrance the computer bounced out of the top basket of the cart and landed on the ground . When I picked up the computer, the screen was shattered . A big male checked me in and processed my request . He was very helpful and knowledgeable . I was then sent to purchase my new computer . Brandon than wrote the work order . Transfer of the data from my shattered computer to new laptop can be done with removal of hard drive from shattered computer . I told Bandon I needed to have two programs installed on my new laptop, Tradelog and Norton 360 . Brandon requested that I get my power cord from my home . Went home picked up the power cord for shattered computer and returned to Best BUY with cord . Schedule pick up for new laptop was for 4/4/2022 . On 4/2/2022 to my delight I received notice that my laptop was ready for pick up . I arrived at Best Buy earlier than my appointment on 4/2/2022 to ensure two programs were installed on my laptop . I was lucky no one was being served so I was able to be served about 7:20 PM . Josh checked me in and proceed to explain what was done to my laptop . I asked him about Norton and Trade Log . Josh was able to download Norton but had trouble with Trade Log . Josh than called Tim to assist him with Trade Log . I explained to Tim that I can only have two copies of Trade Log . One copy was on the shattered computer . Tim immediately said I need to contact Trade Log support to resolve this problem . I told him I pay for your expert knowledge to resolve my computer problems . Josh is a trainee so I didn â t expect him to resolve this problem . We eventually were able to download Trade Log . I am displeased with Tim . On 10/2/2021 Jane purchased a computer from Best Buy and Tim helped her . He recommended an external drive to back up her data so they could transfer her data from her old computer to the new one . I asked Tim at that time if a flash drive would do? He than proceed to tell me that there is no 2 T flash drive, to which I tried to explain to him we had just received a 2 T flash drive from Amazon, he proceeded to assist Jane . I also asked Tim if there was a way that I could back up my computer and transfer to a new computer, he then replied that â s what we get paid to do . As a paying Geek Squad subscriber .

I have the full Geek Squad coverage and tried to have my computer fixed virtually .

My wife then called the GS back and spoke to a Representative that told us that GS doesn't use Team Player software . I then hung up and we called and spoke to a Manager named Daniel and provided him with all the details . Obviously I was very scared they had hacked into my computer, so I quickly called my bank and changed all relevant passwords . This should have never happened as I was told that a Tier 2 technician was to call me back . Instead, somehow a 3rd party knew what was taking place and called me instead .

I spoke first with Talsin (sp) about the 24 â iMac . The advice was what I needed . I was then transferred to a second person, Santiago, He made an appointment for me at tech services, geek squad, for 21 Mar 2022 for 2:40 p.m . I drove over a 100 miles to Casper and was in line before 2:30 . When it was my turn I said I was there for my 2:40 appointment . The female who had asked if she could help me said I didn â t have an appointment, and couldn â t be helped before 4:40 that afternoon . I explained that wouldn â t work for me due to the time and distance I had to drive . She finally said that there was a person due back from lunch â soon â and that I could talk to them . She asked the next person in line why they were there . The lady said she had an appointment for around 4:30 and wanted to leave the item that needed attention with the Geek Squad until she came back . She was told no . The lady picked up her item and said something about an amount of money that she would demand back, and said something to the effect that she wouldn â t be back for a Geek Squad appointment again . The female behind the counter then said loud enough that everyone could hear that people were really being rude to her . I spoke up and said that the two people still in line and the one who had left might disagree with her statement and she might want to think why 3 customers were mad at her . Within about 5 minutes a male appeared behind the counter and appeared to be trying to figure out where to start . He asked the Customer in front of me what he was waiting for and the customer explained that he â d left his new iPhone and Apple Watch at 10:00a.m . And was back to pick it up . Once the Technician found the two pieces he told the customer that the process was still going on . Next it was me and I explained that I had a Samsung TV that I thought had a power button problem since it wasn â t turning on . The male Technician (Luke?) then said he â d see if he could identify what needed done . He plugged the TV in and hooked it up to a DVD player and when he tried to power the TV up . It came right on, and I was amazed! I don â t know why it worked, maybe the 100 mile plus trip had jiggled it enough . The male Technician then did paperwork to explain the time on the TV and no charge . He helped get the TV into my vehicle for the trip home . I then asked to see the manager and went through everything that had happened . I suggested that a fix on the appointment issue appeared to be a policy that didn â t help the customers and that policy needed to be changed . Appointment times don â t work if they aren â t in the system and I suggested that because the only Best Buy in Wyoming was in Casper and that not being able to serve the customer wasn â t beneficial to Best Buy . They needed flexibility . They needed employees who could be flexible, and not insult the customer, and once again it seemed to be tied to some sort of policy . I recommend that a review of the operation of the geek squad policy at the only Best Buy in Wyoming should occur . Flexibility based on the actual location of the store is needed to ensure that the store is meeting the needs of the customer.",0.0945156195156195,0.3414034164034164,see initial comments of my experience with question number please,"See initial comments of my experience with question number 1, Please",0.0,0.0

I thought I was paying all this money for total tech to have them work on my items order the products needed and fix it . It was like it was too much to ask them to fix my issue themselves . Don't get me wrong they do look at the items, but they don't go all out to try and truly fix the issue . I learned that before when they told me that my grandson's laptop needed to be replaced saying that it was no good . All I needed was a new screen we were using a different monitor with the laptop and they made us change the laptop out .

Then, once I explained that they did not return my SIM card, they offered no apology and told me they already shipped it back to apple and there was no way to recover it . When I expressed I was dissatisfied with the service/experience they still offered no apology, and they did not offer to refund my $29 apple care copay . They then accused me of forgetting to put SIM card in or losing it, at which time I told them I never removed the SIM card and was never even told it was removed . They then made a rude remark about how they didn â t house Xfinity Mobile in their store and couldn â t â make â me a SIM card (in a rude condescending tone), and therefore I would just have to drive to the Xfinity store 20 minutes away and deal with it (still, with no apology). It ended up taking me 10+ hours of hassle between the three appointments, various calls with Apple/Best Buy/Xfinity, and a trip to Xfinity Store to simply get the back glass on my iPhone repaired . Apple should discontinue their contract as an â authorized apple repair store â for their apple care plan . I was just about to buy an entire household of new appliances from this store with geek squad extended warranty- that will no longer be happening.",-0.0071022727272727,0.3106263528138528

First claim I didn't have by hard drive replace . Even though I had proof and brought in my old one . Was told that it wasn't place with the correct one that doesn't spin . Was advised to replace my hard drive again . Long story short Angela the supervisor and Tom agreed to give me a discount to have it replaced . They put it in writing . However when I decided to have that service performed . It was a big hassle because there were no notes . The Tech refused to accept the agreement I had in writing . Again Angela stepped in . However The Tech was saying the agreement did not include transferring my data even though it clearly stated that . Angela looked at the agreement and told the Tech it did state transferring the data too . Then again after waiting another twenty some minutes . The Tech came back and said there was again additional Tech support fees . This visit was resolved by Angela admitting the first Tech Tom didn't give me clear info . She offered me the Tech Support at no additional charge to include the full service I needed . Before I went to pick up my laptop I received a call saying they need the code to reinstall my WEBROOT that I just purchased and had installed in January . I was told if I could find the code they would be able to do some kind of refund and issue a new code . The Tech scheduled me an appointment and said it would only take about five minutes . At my appointment again due to a lack of note it became a timely hassle . Tech was saying I didn't purchase a new WEB Root and the only one that had in my records was from 2021 . That the code expired . I asked them to check with Angela . They said she was off . I remember last time I asked Angela what would have happened if she wasn't there to back up the agreement she signed off on . She said they would have called her . (Shouldn't have to call someone on their day off) Could be prevented by noting the file with good notes . I asked the Tech to do as Angela said and call her . He said she was out for a week and they were not able to reach her . Had to get a supervisor involved . This is after I had been going around and around with the Tech for over 30 minutes on what was suppose to be a five minute appointment . Long story short the supervisor was able to figure out that I did indeed purchase a WEBRoot and it was installed January 2022 . Explained what the problem was . I checked my laptop to make sure everything was transferred as the Tech told it would be and my desk top would be set up the same . I noticed my Micro Soft office and Publisher wasn't installed . The Tech told me that I didn't have Publisher . Again several times having been called a liar didn't make me feel like a valued customer . long story short he found out I did have Publisher . But NO apology issued for any of the times I was called a liar . These three experiences make me hesitant to refer anyone to the Geek Squad . I do want to point out that Angela was patient and worked out both situations when she was there.,0.1196969696969697,0.4351803751803752,better training of tech not to assume the customer is lying at least apologize when you realized you made mistake in call the customer liar all of the miscommunication problems could have been prevent with good notes in the record used geek quad in other states with excellent service was shocked not to have received the same level of service at the cary location,Better training of Tech not to assume the customer is lying .

However, it is the setting up the appointment over the phone is a hassle, and trying to simply talk to someone at the Orem Best Buy location (or any store location) afterward is even a much bigger hassle . A few hours after I left Geek Squad Saturday afternoon, I realized that I left my computer power cord on one of the seats in the waiting area . Since Best Buy was now closed, I tried calling the Orem location Sunday to see if my cord was still there on the chair or if someone in Geek Squad had found it . Like my calls before, I get the answering service instead of someone at the actual store . I explained that I simply wanted to speak with someone at the Orem Geek Squad about the cord I forgot, and the person on the phone kept asking me all these unrelated questions like when I bought my computer, what was the purchase order, etc . Again, all I wanted to see was if my power cord was still on the chair or if someone had found it and took it back behind the counter or something . All these stupid non-related questions the person on the phone were unnecessary as I repeated several times that all I wanted was to see about the power cord I left . Finally, he said he needed to talk to someone else as to what to do . When he returned, he said that he would connect me with someone that could help . Well, he connected me to the parts department which is closed on Sunday . I was not looking for parts! Why is it so difficult to just simply transfer me to someone at the Orem Geek Squad? So I called the Orem Best Buy number again and got someone else that was just as inept . I immediately explained what had happened during my previous call and that all I wanted was to ask about the power cord I had accidentally left the day before . Again, I was asked all these unrelated questions . Finally, she said that she would connect me with Geek Squad . I did get instructions to leave a message but there was no beep or signal to indicate when to start the message . Assuming that I was good to go anyway, I left a message explaining about my cord and left my phone number . As of this writing, not return call .
