I asked for a battery replacement for a phone that was simply to be used as a toy for my nine year old . I knew the phone was old and not in great shape, I just wanted to do something small to make the phone a bit better . Instead, the tech person was forced to go through an entire diagnostic thing (even though I told him I was not going to pay for any other services and so the diagnostic results were irrelevant). I was there for almost an hour, only to be told at the end that they would not replace my battery because Apple wouldn't allow that . I understand that is not the fault of Geek Squad, BUT it was a terrible waste of my time and I think the entire thing could have been much more efficient if he hadn't first had to do the entire diagnostic . Also, when I arrived and told him why I was there (not sure why he didn't already know that since I made an appointment and was asked what service I needed), the first thing he did was check to see if they had a battery in the back, which was shocking to me . I scheduled the appointment and said why I was coming, Geek Squad should check prior to appointments to make sure all parts are available for the service . Essentially, I wanted one very simple service, spent an entire hour at the store have tests run on my phone that I didn't want, and then was denied the service . It showed very little regard for my time or right to make my own decisions about my own device . The tech support guy was very nice, so I don't blame him .

Then I got emails that said if I don't pick up my parts (that I paid for!), they would be sent back . So, I had to extend the hold on my parts . I got the radio and spoke to the intaller about the fact that I was getting Sirius XM and he said it was going to be easy for me to set it up . The instructions were on the receipt . But, after fiddling with my radio for an hour, then calling a help desk, I still couldn't get Sirius XM . I came to the store and a female there said she didn't know how to resolve this but that if I came back on Wednesday, she would be there to help me (she was going to ask the radio installer how to do it). Well, I came back on Wednesday and of course she WASN'T there . But, some nice fellow came out to my car with me & tried his hardest to get it to work . After about 50 minutes, he discovered that I never paid for the extra part needed and that is most likely why I couldn't get it to work . I never noticed that I didn't get that extra part . Didn't even think to look because 2 people rang me up the day I purchased everything & they both kept saying .."" she needs this, and this, etc ."" They assured me that I had everything I would need . So finally, I went to Best Buy on Saturday and spoke with the installer guy . He said, yes, I would need that part to get Sirius XM .

I spoke first with Talsin (sp) about the 24 ” iMac . The advice was what I needed . I was then transferred to a second person, Santiago, He made an appointment for me at tech services, geek squad, for 21 Mar 2022 for 2:40 p.m . I drove over a 100 miles to Casper and was in line before 2:30 . When it was my turn I said I was there for my 2:40 appointment . The female who had asked if she could help me said I didn ’ t have an appointment, and couldn ’ t be helped before 4:40 that afternoon . I explained that wouldn ’ t work for me due to the time and distance I had to drive . She finally said that there was a person due back from lunch “ soon ” and that I could talk to them . She asked the next person in line why they were there . The lady said she had an appointment for around 4:30 and wanted to leave the item that needed attention with the Geek Squad until she came back . She was told no . The lady picked up her item and said something about an amount of money that she would demand back, and said something to the effect that she wouldn ’ t be back for a Geek Squad appointment again . The female behind the counter then said loud enough that everyone could hear that people were really being rude to her . I spoke up and said that the two people still in line and the one who had left might disagree with her statement and she might want to think why 3 customers were mad at her . Within about 5 minutes a male appeared behind the counter and appeared to be trying to figure out where to start . He asked the Customer in front of me what he was waiting for and the customer explained that he ’ d left his new iPhone and Apple Watch at 10:00a.m . And was back to pick it up . Once the Technician found the two pieces he told the customer that the process was still going on . Next it was me and I explained that I had a Samsung TV that I thought had a power button problem since it wasn ’ t turning on . The male Technician (Luke?) then said he ’ d see if he could identify what needed done . He plugged the TV in and hooked it up to a DVD player and when he tried to power the TV up . It came right on, and I was amazed! I don ’ t know why it worked, maybe the 100 mile plus trip had jiggled it enough . The male Technician then did paperwork to explain the time on the TV and no charge . He helped get the TV into my vehicle for the trip home . I then asked to see the manager and went through everything that had happened . I suggested that a fix on the appointment issue appeared to be a policy that didn ’ t help the customers and that policy needed to be changed . Appointment times don ’ t work if they aren ’ t in the system and I suggested that because the only Best Buy in Wyoming was in Casper and that not being able to serve the customer wasn ’ t beneficial to Best Buy . They needed flexibility . They needed employees who could be flexible, and not insult the customer, and once again it seemed to be tied to some sort of policy . I recommend that a review of the operation of the geek squad policy at the only Best Buy in Wyoming should occur . Flexibility based on the actual location of the store is needed to ensure that the store is meeting the needs of the customer.",0.0945156195156195,0.3414034164034164,see initial comments of my experience with question number please,"See initial comments of my experience with question number 1, Please",0.0,0.0

I have total tech and it feels like the total tech is worthless for me . I am willing to pay extra if I need to to have my items fixed . Instead what I get is recommendations to do other things myself . Order the item online and then have geek squad to install it for me . I thought I was paying all this money for total tech to have them work on my items order the products needed and fix it . It was like it was too much to ask them to fix my issue themselves . Don't get me wrong they do look at the items, but they don't go all out to try and truly fix the issue . I learned that before when they told me that my grandson's laptop needed to be replaced saying that it was no good . All I needed was a new screen we were using a different monitor with the laptop and they made us change the laptop out . So I understand that whenever I go to geek squad I have to use a grain of salt because I will get lies and sometimes help but most likely not very much help .

That would have been very nice but I had to ask about that myself it was never even offered .

Apparently my husband's fan inside of the laptop had dog fur in it or capworks we have dogs and cats a whole bunch of them and they pulled some of it out but they were not willing to pull all of it out to see if the fan even worked .

I asked the guy there for help finding it on Amazon but that totally ignored oh he heard me but wouldn't even help .

What I've come to learn is I had great results with Christian, a former Geek Squad employee . He was worth every penny I paid to Geek Squad . Recently I needed to seek Geek Squad services again . This time I had very different results . I explained to the young lady what I needed to be done and she took notes . I told her I lived 90 miles away and I would be back in four days to pick up my computer, as I had a doctor's appt on that date . She went to the back room to check with the service techs . When she came back she said they had hardly any computers to work on so that was fine . I come back four days later, having just come from surgery, to find my computer not done . Not just ""Not Done BUT Not even looked at!!!"" I will give Austin credit . He was called in on his day off and he was doing his best to get things done . Plus, he's a kid! In addition to just having surgery, I had to wait three more hours while they tried to work on my computer . So I ended up buying a hard drive for $100 to be set up as a Time Machine that did not get done . I paid $200 for Geek Squad services and I truly do not think they did anything . I took in a couple of photo sticks to have them upload pictures on because I could not get them to work . They didn't even look at that! Austin was nice, I will give you that . Other than that, it was a total waste of my time and money . Not to mention I was in pain and because I had to wait an additional three hours, I was unable to get my medication filled that night .

I went into the store intending to buy a different brand, but when I got there, I ended up changing my mind . I thought the Lenovo machine was a bit skimpy on drive space, but I read the spec sheet on the display model, which said I could add an internal hard drive if I needed to . Based on that and the clearance price, I decided to buy this instead of the competing brand I had intended to buy when I went into the store . Now that the warranty is running out, I bought a hard drive for it, opened it up, and found an empty drive bay, but nothing to connect it to . I thought I was crazy, or maybe that the machine was missing a part, so I brought it to Geek Squad to figure it out . The guy I talked to confirmed that there's no place to connect a hard drive in this machine, despite what the spec sheet says, but said that I would have to go thru Lenovo to address this shortcoming .

First claim I didn't have by hard drive replace . Even though I had proof and brought in my old one . Was told that it wasn't place with the correct one that doesn't spin . Was advised to replace my hard drive again . Long story short Angela the supervisor and Tom agreed to give me a discount to have it replaced . They put it in writing . However when I decided to have that service performed . It was a big hassle because there were no notes . The Tech refused to accept the agreement I had in writing . Again Angela stepped in . However The Tech was saying the agreement did not include transferring my data even though it clearly stated that . Angela looked at the agreement and told the Tech it did state transferring the data too . Then again after waiting another twenty some minutes . The Tech came back and said there was again additional Tech support fees . This visit was resolved by Angela admitting the first Tech Tom didn't give me clear info . She offered me the Tech Support at no additional charge to include the full service I needed . Before I went to pick up my laptop I received a call saying they need the code to reinstall my WEBROOT that I just purchased and had installed in January . I was told if I could find the code they would be able to do some kind of refund and issue a new code . The Tech scheduled me an appointment and said it would only take about five minutes . At my appointment again due to a lack of note it became a timely hassle . Tech was saying I didn't purchase a new WEB Root and the only one that had in my records was from 2021 . That the code expired . I asked them to check with Angela . They said she was off . I remember last time I asked Angela what would have happened if she wasn't there to back up the agreement she signed off on . She said they would have called her . (Shouldn't have to call someone on their day off) Could be prevented by noting the file with good notes . I asked the Tech to do as Angela said and call her . He said she was out for a week and they were not able to reach her . Had to get a supervisor involved . This is after I had been going around and around with the Tech for over 30 minutes on what was suppose to be a five minute appointment . Long story short the supervisor was able to figure out that I did indeed purchase a WEBRoot and it was installed January 2022 . Explained what the problem was . I checked my laptop to make sure everything was transferred as the Tech told it would be and my desk top would be set up the same . I noticed my Micro Soft office and Publisher wasn't installed . The Tech told me that I didn't have Publisher . Again several times having been called a liar didn't make me feel like a valued customer . long story short he found out I did have Publisher . But NO apology issued for any of the times I was called a liar . These three experiences make me hesitant to refer anyone to the Geek Squad . I do want to point out that Angela was patient and worked out both situations when she was there.,0.1196969696969697,0.4351803751803752,better training of tech not to assume the customer is lying at least apologize when you realized you made mistake in call the customer liar all of the miscommunication problems could have been prevent with good notes in the record used geek quad in other states with excellent service was shocked not to have received the same level of service at the cary location,Better training of Tech not to assume the customer is lying .

However, it is the setting up the appointment over the phone is a hassle, and trying to simply talk to someone at the Orem Best Buy location (or any store location) afterward is even a much bigger hassle . A few hours after I left Geek Squad Saturday afternoon, I realized that I left my computer power cord on one of the seats in the waiting area . Since Best Buy was now closed, I tried calling the Orem location Sunday to see if my cord was still there on the chair or if someone in Geek Squad had found it . Like my calls before, I get the answering service instead of someone at the actual store . I explained that I simply wanted to speak with someone at the Orem Geek Squad about the cord I forgot, and the person on the phone kept asking me all these unrelated questions like when I bought my computer, what was the purchase order, etc . Again, all I wanted to see was if my power cord was still on the chair or if someone had found it and took it back behind the counter or something . All these stupid non-related questions the person on the phone were unnecessary as I repeated several times that all I wanted was to see about the power cord I left . Finally, he said he needed to talk to someone else as to what to do . When he returned, he said that he would connect me with someone that could help . Well, he connected me to the parts department which is closed on Sunday . I was not looking for parts! Why is it so difficult to just simply transfer me to someone at the Orem Geek Squad? So I called the Orem Best Buy number again and got someone else that was just as inept . I immediately explained what had happened during my previous call and that all I wanted was to ask about the power cord I had accidentally left the day before . Again, I was asked all these unrelated questions . Finally, she said that she would connect me with Geek Squad . I did get instructions to leave a message but there was no beep or signal to indicate when to start the message . Assuming that I was good to go anyway, I left a message explaining about my cord and left my phone number . As of this writing, not return call .

I purchased a new laptop and left it with the Geek Squad at 10:00 on a Friday morning along with an external hard drive for data transfer . I was told the data transfer would take 2 - 3 days . I got a call on Monday morning (Memorial Day) to set up an appointment for that afternoon . I had plans so the 1 hour appointment was set for Tuesday morning at 10:30 . When I got there, the technician sat with me for the 1 hour struggling to set up my Outlook from an external email account . When he told me my hour was up and I needed to schedule another appointment, I asked to see the data that was transferred . He told me that the only instructions he had were to set up Outlook . I pointed out that he had my external hard drive sitting right next to the laptop and the guy that took everything on Friday was standing right next to him . Throughout the whole process the technician kept going in to a back room . Either he had a bad bladder, was in the middle of a hot text exchange or had to consult with the Wizard before he did anything .

Rather than set up another appointment after an ""advanced technician"" had a chance to work on it, I requested a refund . I then purchased a laptop at Costco, set up the email by myself on Thursday night and I am now up and running . I will NEVER purchase a product from Best Buy and I would certainly NEVER recommend the Geek Squad .
